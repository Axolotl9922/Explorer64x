# General  Info #
This is just a buggy code, I made because I was bored.

## Navigation ##
Navigate by the up and down arrows. Press enter to open a folder or open a file. Use alt+f4 to quit.

## Search Feature ##
Warning: This is the most buggy part
To enter the search mode, press 'S' and start typing. Backspace and Delete don't work! Press enter to lock in the query and then you can navigate around (see above!). If you want to clear your search query and exit search mode, press Escape!

#### Note: This will never be updated ####
